Simple general info for the empire and running the code:

------- Common terminal commands ---------
Compile and upload code to screeps:
    rollup -c --environment DEST:main       // compile and upload once
    rollup -cw --environment DEST:main      // watch the code to compile and reupload on save

Git Command Line Cheat Sheet:

        stage a single file
    git add -u
        stage all unstaged files that you previous staged
    git add .
        stage all unstaged files

    git commit -m "commit message here"
        commit with a message
    git commit
        commit and opens up vi in terminal with info about your commit, write message and do :wq to save commit

    git push
        i mean yeah... lol
    git push -f
        force replace the origin branch with your local branch

    git rebase {branch name}
        rebase a branch into your current HEAD (puts all your commits after the last commit on the branch you're bringing in)
    git pull
        git fetch and git merge mixed into one command

    git checkout {branch name}
        checkout a new branch off your current local HEAD
    git checkout {old branch name} -b {new branch name}
        checkout a new branch off the old branch (ie git checkout origin/master -b coolnewfeature)
    git branch

-------- Flag Types ---------
Remote Flag:
    Yellow + any

Claim Flag:
    White + any

Attack Flags:
    Red + Red = Standard Squad
        (1 zealot, 1 medic, 1 stalker)

    Red + Blue = Zealot Solo
        (1 zealot)

    Red + Brown = Stalker Solo
        (1 stalker)

Option Flags:
    Green + White = Override Depedent Room
        (place this in the room you want to be the host room, applies to next dependent room flag)

    Green + Yellow = Stimulate Flag
        (place this in the room you want to be stimulated, must have a terminal)


-------- Known Bugs --------
    Stimulate flag doesn't properly process
    Depedent override flag processes and works fine, but still gives console warning as if it isn't a correct flag type
    Harvesters losing job on the way to it (will be fixed by marking jobs as taken)
